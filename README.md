## 🎓 About My Journey

When it comes to earning a degree in computer science, it takes hard work and commitment. That’s why it’s good to know what may happen after you graduate. Computer scientists work in a variety of industries. This is because the world is becoming more and more dependent on computers and technology.

I’m excited to be part of this evolution—building and designing software that makes a difference.
